## <a id="ver"></a> v1.3.0

**Release Date:** August 10, 2021

- CyberArk Conjur Service Broker - [v1.2.1](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-service-broker/releases/v1.2.1)
- CyberArk Conjur Buildpack - [v2.2.1](https://github.com/cyberark/cloudfoundry-conjur-buildpack/releases/v2.2.1)

Features in this release:

* Removed support for Conjur Enterprise v4
  - We recommend migrating to Conjur Enterprise v11+ or Conjur OSS v1+.
  - [cyberark/conjur-service-broker#203](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-service-broker/issues/203)

* Add organization_name and space_name annotations
  - Service Broker API spec 2.15 and above provide `organization_name` and
    `space_name`. If these are available, they are added as annotations on the
    organization and space policies that are created in Conjur. [cyberark/conjur-service-broker#238](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-service-broker/issues/238)
  - Requires Conjur Open Source v1.3.7+ or Conjur Enterprise (formerly Dynamic Access Provider) v11.3.0+

* Support for using Summon environments in secrets.yml file
  - secrets.yml files can be split into sections by environment and secrets to
    load at runtime can be specified using new SECRETS_YAML_ENVIRONMENT
    variable. [cyberark/cloudfoundry-conjur-buildpack#44](https://github.com/cyberark/cloudfoundry-conjur-buildpack/issues/44)

* Fixed error messages with invalid line numbers
  - Caused by Cloudfoundry Buildpack encountering errors while parsing environment
    variable settings after retrieving secrets from Conjur. [cyberark/cloudfoundry-conjur-buildpack#120](https://github.com/cyberark/cloudfoundry-conjur-buildpack/issues/120)

Fixed issues in this release:

* Upgraded Ruby dependencies to resolve security vulnerabilities
  - [cyberark/conjur-service-broker#241](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-service-broker/pull/241),
    [cyberark/conjur-service-broker#246](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-service-broker/pull/246),
    [cyberark/conjur-service-broker#251](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-service-broker/pull/251)

Known issues in this release:

* Service broker fails if not installed with ruby buildpack v1.8.37
  - The service broker currently requires Ruby 2.5.8, which was removed in ruby
    buildpack versions later than v1.8.37. As a result, we have pinned the
    service broker to use v1.8.37 [cyberark/conjur-service-broker#253](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-service-broker/pull/253)

## <a id="ver"></a> v1.2.1

**Release Date:** January 15, 2021

- CyberArk Conjur Service Broker - [v1.1.4](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-service-broker/releases/v1.1.4)
- CyberArk Conjur Buildpack - [v2.1.6](https://github.com/cyberark/cloudfoundry-conjur-buildpack/releases/v2.1.6)

Features in this release:

* Buildpack archives releases in branch for more reliable online buildpack usage
  - Previously, we recommended users refer to the project master branch in
    GitHub when using the online buildpack. With this change, we now archive
    releases in the "latest" branch, and recommend users either refer to the
    latest branch or a specific tag when using the online version of this
    buildpack. [cyberark/cloudfoundry-conjur-buildpack#101](https://github.com/cyberark/cloudfoundry-conjur-buildpack/issues/101)

* Service broker sets the default value of CONJUR_VERSION to 5
  - When the value for CONJUR_VERSION is null or empty, we default to `5`.
    If an invalid value is given, we raise an error immediately.
    [cyberark/conjur-service-broker#47](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-service-broker/issues/47)

* Support for using the Conjur Tile with Conjur Enterprise v4 is now deprecated.
  - Support will be removed in the next release.
    [cyberark/cloudfoundry-conjur-buildpack#73](https://github.com/cyberark/cloudfoundry-conjur-buildpack/issues/73), [cyberark/conjur-service-broker#191](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-service-broker/issues/191)

Fixed issues in this release:

* **(Security)** Buildpack can no longer log secret values given invalid secrets.yml keys
  - See [Security Advisory](https://github.com/cyberark/cloudfoundry-conjur-buildpack/security/advisories/GHSA-3gqg-6hwf-vq8x).
    We recommend all users update their buildpack version to at least v2.1.5;
    v2.1.6 is included in this tile release.

Known issues in this release:

* Service Broker fails to install if using older versions of Ruby Buildpack
  - When using Ruby Buildpack version 1.8.15 or older, the service broker will fail to install because the Ruby
    version will default to 2.4.x.
    [cyberark/conjur-service-broker#229](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-service-broker/issues/229)

## <a id="ver"></a> v1.2.0

**Release Date:** August 7, 2020

- CyberArk Conjur Service Broker - [v1.1.3](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-service-broker/releases/v1.1.3)
- CyberArk Conjur Buildpack - [v2.1.4](https://github.com/cyberark/cloudfoundry-conjur-buildpack/releases/v2.1.4)

Features in this release:

* Improved service-broker validation and error handling
  <br/>
  - Service broker returns 404 when the org or space policy branches do not exist
    as expected with a helpful error message, rather than returning 500.
  - If a value is given to the `CONJUR_POLICY` environment variable, service-broker 
    verifies that the given policy exists on the server, and provides a helpful error 
    if it does not exist.

* Expanded buildpack configuration capabilities 
  <br/>
  - The runtime location for `secrets.yml` can now be configured by setting the
    `SECRETS_YAML_PATH` environment variable for the Cloud Foundry application.
  - Buildpack supply step now scans build directory for candidate `secrets.yml` files,
    and reports them to the buildpack deploy output during the supply phase. If unable to
    locate any `secrets.yml` files, it will exit. 

* The buildpack now properly reads only the Conjur credentials from VCAP_SERVICES. Previously, it   
  could consume credentials for other services, if their field names exactly matched those used by 
  Conjur (e.g. version is a very common field).

Known issues in this release:

* Invalid variable name causes secret exposure in logs
  - See [Security Advisory](https://github.com/cyberark/cloudfoundry-conjur-buildpack/security/advisories/GHSA-3gqg-6hwf-vq8x).
    This is fixed in the buildpack [v2.1.5](https://github.com/cyberark/cloudfoundry-conjur-buildpack/releases/v2.1.5).

  individually. [Read more about this here.](installing.html#space-scoped-identity)

## <a id="ver"></a> v1.0.0

**Release Date:** March 7, 2019

  - Applications are auto-enrolled into org and space layers on bind.

* Applications use Conjur followers to retrieve secrets for a improved scalability

  functionality
