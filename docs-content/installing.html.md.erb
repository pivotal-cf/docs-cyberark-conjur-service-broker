Choose appropriate values to configure where to deploy CyberArk Conjur Service Broker for PCF.

This tab configures communication between the Service Broker and a Conjur appliance.

  * **Conjur Account**: The organization account assigned during Conjur appliance installation. If you are using a hosted Conjur instance for a proof of concept, the account is typically your email address.
  
  * **Conjur Appliance URL**: The URL of the Conjur appliance that you are connecting to.
  
  * **Conjur Login**: The username of a Conjur user. 
  
  The user  must have `create` and `update`  privileges on the Conjur policy on the dedicated PCF policy ID you enter in the **PCF Conjur Policy Namespace** field. If you are not using a dedicated PCF policy namespace, this login user must have `create` and `update` privileges on the Conjur root policy. 
  
  This login is only used by the Service Broker to add and remove hosts from the Conjur policy files as your applications are deployed to or removed from PCF. 

  * **Conjur API Key**: The API key of the Conjur user whose username you provided in the **Conjur Login** field. 

  If the user's API key changes, you need to update this field and click **Apply Changes** to continue using the Service Broker to bind applications. After binding, an application has its own credentials for connecting to the Conjur appliance.        

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The Conjur user credentials configured here are available only to PCF admins. They are not generally accessible to users in PCF.</p>

  * **Conjur Policy**: The policy namespace you created for PCF. Leave blank to default to the root policy (not recommended). 
  
  * **Conjur Version**: Defaults to 5. Select 4 for Enterprise Conjur. Select 5 for Open Source Conjur (including an evaluation Hosted Conjur).
  
  * **Conjur Certificate**: Required for Conjur Enterprise only. Copy and paste the contents of the .pem file that was created by the `conjur init` command when the Conjur appliance was configured. Be sure to include the Begin and End lines in the certificate.  
  
  The .pem file is located in the root folder where Conjur was created. The file name is `conjur-account.pem`, where *account* is the account name provided for  the  Conjur instance.

###<a id='config-buildpack'></a>Buildpack Setttings  


Do not change the installed sequence. `meta_buildpack` must install first, and `conjur_buildpack` must install second. 

###<a id='config-service-access'></a>Service Access

If **Enable global access to plans of service Conjur** is checked, the Conjur service is available to all PCF users, across all orgs and spaces.   
   
To configure more precise access control, uncheck this option and use `cf enable-service-access` to specify which orgs and spaces can access the Conjur service.    

###<a id='config-errands'></a>Errands

The CyberArk Conjur Service Broker for PCF tile does not add any errands.  

###<a id='config-resources'></a>Resource Config 

The default settings are appropriate. 

###<a id='config-stemcell'></a>Stemcell 
 
The latest major stemcell release is required by CyberArk Conjur Service Broker for PCF. 

If the Stemcell side tab has a green checkmark, you have the latest release and no action is required.

If the Stemcell side tab has an orange circle, install the requested stemcell.
