<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> The CyberArk Conjur Service Broker for PCF tile is currently in beta and is intended for evaluation and test purposes only. 
Do not use this product in a PCF production environment.</p>

This documentation describes the CyberArk Conjur Service Broker for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). This service broker provides Conjur machine identity management and authentication, policy-based authorization, and other Conjur services to your PCF applications and microservices. 


## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

The CyberArk Conjur Service Broker for PCF registers a service broker with PCF and exposes its service plans on the Marketplace. Developers can then create applications that access a Conjur appliance. The service broker provides the interface between your PCF applications and a Conjur appliance. 

The CyberArk Conjur Service Broker for PCF installs a buildpack that includes the Conjur Summon tool. Summon fetches secrets from Conjur using the binding ID from your PCF service as the unique application identity.  


## <a id='features'></a>Key Features

CyberArk Conjur Service Broker for PCF includes the following key features:

* After you configure the tile and bind applications to service instances, your PCF applications, containers, and microservices assume a host identity in Conjur. This identity enables secure access to secret values and policy grants stored in Conjur.
* If you have an existing Conjur appliance, Conjur policy can grant privileges to the PCF applications to access the existing Conjur secrets.      
* Conjur integrates easily into the PCF environment and the PCF developer workflow.  
* The strong authentication model provided by Conjur is available to PCF applications. 
* The Conjur role-based policy model for authorizations applies to applications running in PCF.  
* Access to secrets is configurable at the PCF application level, making it easy to ensure least privilege access.

## <a id="reqs"></a>Requirements

CyberArk Conjur Service Broker for PCF has the following requirements:

+ The CyberArk Conjur Service Broker for PCF requires that you have an existing version 5 Conjur appliance installed. The Conjur appliance may be external to the PCF environment. 
  * If you do not already have a running Conjur appliance, you can quickly get a hosted evaluation Conjur instance running. Visit the [hosted Conjur page](https://www.conjur.org/get-started/try-conjur.html) to sign up for a hosted Conjur instance.
+ To configure the tile, you must know the Conjur appliance Account ID, a valid Conjur user name, and associated API Key.  
  * The Account ID is specified when the Conjur appliance is created and configured. For hosted Conjur, the account is usually an email address that you specify on the web form.
  * The Conjur user must have update and create privileges on the root Conjur policy. These privileges will be used to add and remove hosts from the Conjur policy as applications are deployed to or removed from PCF.
